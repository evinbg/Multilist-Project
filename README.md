## Compiling Instructions
I created this project on Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, so creating a new empty C++ project and 
inserting the files into the Source Files should allow the code to run in Visual Studio. 
You have to put the multilist_input.txt file in the Visual Studio project's directory, 
which usually looks something like: `C:\Users\Username\source\repos\Multilist\Multilist\`
  
I also included a makefile, so the code can run on the Unix command line. The command to run the 
code is `make run`.
